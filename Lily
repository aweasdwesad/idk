----
Lily was a little girl
Afraid of the big wide World 
She grew up,within her Castle walls
Now and then she tried to run 
And then on the night with the setting Sun
She ran in the Woods away
So Afraid,all alone
They warned her,don't go there
Theres creatures
Who are hiding in the dark
Then something
Came creeping
It told her,don't you worry just
Follow everywhere i go 
Top over the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreamimg of
just let me in ooh 
Everything you wantin' gonna be the magic Story you've been told 
And you'll be save under my control 
just let me in ooh
She knew she Was hyptnotized 
And walking on could thin ice
Then it broke,and she awoke again
Then she ran,faster and
Start screamin :is the somone out there?
Please help me
Come get me
Behind her,she can hear it say:
Follow everwhere i go
Top over the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreaming of
just let me in ooh
Everything you wantin' gonna be the macig Story you've been told
And you'll be save under my control 
just let me in ooh
just let me in ooh
Everything you wantin' gonna be the magic Story you've been told
And you'll be save under my control
just let me in ooh
Follow everywhere i go 
Top over the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreaming of 
just let me in ooh
Then she ran 
Faster and,start screamin:
Is the somone out there 
Please help me!
just let me in ooh
Song Finished - Lily
